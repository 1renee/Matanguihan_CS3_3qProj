	<h1><i>How Can You Help?</i></h1>
	<h2><i>Give Gifts!</i></h2>
	<h4>Gifts provide DBSA with the support they need to continue their mission.</h4>
	<h4>Make a contribution with your Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover card by calling
or emailing Jessica Chervinko. <a href="mailto:jchervinko@dbsalliance.org">(jchervinko@dbsalliance.org)</h4>
	<h4>Print out the online donation form, complete and mail it to DBSA with your check, money
order, debit, or credit card information (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or American Express) to
the address mentioned above.</h4>
<h4>Become a wellness ally and give automated, monthly donations.</h4> 
<h4>Make a gift of stock or crypto. A gift of stock or crypto may provide more benefits than a cash
gift. You can eliminate the capital gains tax that would be due upon selling stock, you receive
tangible tax savings and benefits while also supporting DBSA.</h4>
<h4>Memorials or Honorariums. Memorials and honorariums are a special way to pay tribute to a
loved one, or to express your admiration for someone who has made a contribution, either to
DBSA or to the greater community.</h4>
<h4>Bequests and Estate Gifts. Making a gift to DBSA as part of your legacy ensures that you will
be helping people to live better lives for years to come.</h4>
<h2><i>Employee Giving</i></h2>
<h4>Grow your gift by contacting your human resource department about the different employee
match programs available to you. Employee match programs are an easy way to increase
your giving without going over your budget. All you have to do is give your human resources
department our contact information and make your gift. We will confirm your gift with your
employer and they will match your gift according to their policy. Many employers will even
match your or your partnerâ€™s gift even after you retire.</h4>
