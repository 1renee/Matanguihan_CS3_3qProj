	<h2><i>The History of DBSA</i></h2>
	<h4>The beginnings of DBSA go way back to when it was still the Manic Depressive Association
(MDA) in 1978. The MDA hosted its first convention in Chicago in 1984, where approximately
50 leaders from 14 states were in attendance. 2 years later in 1986, the MDA became the
NDMDA (National Depression and Manic Depression Association) and started using "Honk If
You're On Lithium" as its promotional slogan. In 1994, NDMDA published its first large-scale
self-survey for the members of its chapters. NDMDA becomes replaced with DBSA in 2003 to
reflect modern psychiatric terminology. Then, in 2010, DBSA begins advancing its depression
and bipolar research to learn more about the disorders that cause so much trouble on the
human minds. In 2016, DBSA created its first online support groups to help those who lack
easy access to the local support groups. DBSA launches its website in 2019 which then
proves to be a great help as soon as 2020 rolls around, allowing them to give support to
people even amidst the Covid Pandemic. <i>(DBSA, 2022)</i></h4>
