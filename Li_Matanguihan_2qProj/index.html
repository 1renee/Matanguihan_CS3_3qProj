	<h3>The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) is an
organization stationed in America that focuses on mood disorders,
which affect over 21 million Americans, account for over 50% of
the nation's suicides every year, and cost $23 billion in lost
workdays and other workplace losses.
</h3>
<h3>DBSA offers peer-based, wellness-oriented support and
empowering services and resources available when people need
them, where they need them, and how they need to receive themâ€”
online, in local support groups, in audio and video casts, or in
printed materials distributed by DBSA, our chapters, and mental
health care facilities across America.
</h3>
<h3>Through their extensive resources and 450 support groups across
the country, DBSA reaches millions of people each year with inperson and online peer support; current, readily understandable
information about depression and bipolar disorder; and
empowering tools focused on an integrated approach to wellness.

	<h2><i>Why This Advocacy?</i></h2>
	<h3>As a person with bipolar disorder, I personally know the struggles
and pain of everyday life, and seeing people go through the same
thing I do hurts. I chose this advocacy so I could help the many
struggling people in my own way, and so I could help educate
many others on the many mood disorders that affect everyone's
day-to-day life.
